## Blockchain
Standby Letters of Credit (SLOC) are legal documents to ensure sellers are paid, and buyers are going to receive the goods or services specified in the contract. These contracts are typically conducted via email, which often results in both errors and delays. 

NBC partnered with IT firm CGI and blockchain startup Skuchain to implement the use of smart contracts to combat the mentioned issues. Using this technology, NBC aims to improve SLOC processing times, reduce risks, and help strengthen customer relationships due to improved customer experience.
